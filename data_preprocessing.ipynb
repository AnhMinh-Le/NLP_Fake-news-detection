The bill, which was approved with some modifications, is considered the cornerstone of the peace agreement signed last year between the government and the FARC, known until recently as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The special courts will mete out alternative sentences like landmine removal for ex-guerrilla leaders who are convicted of war crimes committed during the five-decade war. Under the peace deal, those convicted will not serve time in traditional jails. The lower house made changes to the text agreed this month by the Senate, so it must now go for conciliation between the two chambers. Once there is agreement on alterations the bill will go to President Juan Manuel Santos to be signed into law.  With this step, we move towards peace: transitional justice guarantees the rights of the victims and establishes the basis for the reconciliation of Colombians,  Santos said on Twitter. Congress had until the end of the month to approve the law using a court-approved  fast-track  mechanism to reduce the number of required debates in an effort to implement the peace accord as quickly as possible. The FARC, now a political party known as the Revolutionary Alternative Common Force, has argued against any changes to the original agreement, including extradition for crimes committed after demobilization. The law, which would also apply to members of the military who have been accused of atrocities, is part of the agreement that allowed more than 11,000 members of the FARC - combatants and others - to lay down their arms and enter politics. With the modifications, the FARC will be able to participate in politics, but face the risk of losing benefits if they committed sexual abuse against minors. They can be also be extradited for crimes committed after the culmination of the peace process.  We have achieved an agreement with teeth,  said Rodrigo Lara, president of the lower house.  Any FARC member who commits a another crime will immediately leave the special regime and go to the ordinary jurisdiction. Sexual crimes will not be protected.   The leader of the FARC, Rodrigo Londono, a presidential candidate for next year s election, has said any changes put at risk the implementation of the peace agreement. Under the agreement the FARC will have 10 guaranteed seats in Congress until 2026. The group has announced a slate of candidates for elections next year. \",\n          \"Organized protesters took to the streets outside of the brand new Little Caesars Arena in Detroit to protest Kid Rock s concert tonight, calling him a  racist  for using a confederate flag in his southern concerts years ago. The truth is that Kid Rock, who is a single father of a black son, and the recipient of the Detroit NAACP s great expectations award in acknowledgment of his work in helping the black community in Detroit, doesn t have a racist bone in his body. Liberal protesters are also pointing to Rock s public remarks expressing his disgust for Colin Kaepernick for disrespecting our flag by kneeling during our national anthem.  We all know the protests are being organized because the left fears Rock is serious about challenging the 2-term liberal US Senator Debbie ( rubber stamp ) Stabenow:Kid Rock has done more to help the city of Detroit than any elected official in recent history, yet people like Stephen Henderson, the race-obsessed editorial editor of the Detroit Free Press just can t help but criticize the rocker with a heart of gold and a passion for helping others who have either fallen on hard times or have bravely served our nation, by suggesting that Rock is a  racist. This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem. Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Sadly, it s people like Stephen Henderson who are so steeped in hate for anyone who doesn t buy into his nonsensical rhetoric, that will keep the hateful and divisive course Barack Obama set for our nation alive and well Here are just a few of many examples of how Kid Rock has given back to so many. These are videos you ll never see in the mainstream media. #1. 30-year old Dan Bawita is one of Kid Rock s biggest fans. As he sat at a table in a local restaurant in Michigan celebrating his birthday with friends and family, he got the surprise of his life when a very unexpected guest showed up to help him celebrate. Not only did Robert Ritchie, aka Kid Rock show up to surprise Dan, he spent over 2 hours hanging out with him and sharing a few pretty special gifts with his new friend.#2. In 2011, U.S. Army Sgt. Davin Dumar lost his left leg and suffered several other injuries during a deployment to Afghanistan. After 70 surgeries, Dan and his wife Dana wanted to move back to Michigan and settle down where they grew up. Kid Rock worked a local Michigan builder, Pulte Homes, and Operation Finally Home to build a home for the wounded vet and his wife. Watch Kid Rock, as he helps to surprise the couple with their new home:#3. Kid Rock didn t just visit the troops in Baghdad, he visited our troops while they were in a combat zone. A true American badass #4. In 2008, Kid Rock visited the troops in Al Asad, Iraq, for a Christmas concert. He started the concert by giving a speech thanking the troops for helping to protect our freedom of speech.    Watch him sing  All Summer Long  for the troops. ***Language warning***#5. In 2012, when the Detroit Symphony Orchestra was in danger of folding due to lack of funds, Kid Rock stepped up to the plate and performed a full-blown concert with the symphony to help raise money for the amazing group of musicians, who 5 years later, are still playing.***As a bonus (and because I also attended Romeo High School) we decided to include this video of Robert Ritchie surprising the high school he attended with a $5K gift to be used to help boost their arts program.\",\n          \"OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Friday he doubted whether Donald Trump could undo much of the current administration\\u2019s record on the environment because so many green policies have firmly taken hold. Trump, who will take over as president on Jan. 20, has said he does not believe in global warming and will name a climate change skeptic, Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, to head the Environmental Protection Agency. The Republican is expected to nominate another climate change skeptic, U.S. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington state, to head the Interior Department, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters on Friday. Democratic President Barack Obama has made the fight against global warming a priority, and Biden said businesses now realized his policies made sense economically. \\u201cThere is a constituency that crosses party lines. Regardless of whether the next administration is as aggressive as we have been - and I\\u2019m not suggesting they intend to  - there is no way to turn back this tide that has begun to roll,\\u201d the vice president told a Canadian environmental summit. The Obama administration has lifted vehicle fuel standards, invested heavily in renewable energy, pushed to curb methane gas emissions and adopted a Clean Power Plan that requires states to cut carbon output. Biden said that in some parts of the United States it was now cheaper to use solar or wind power rather than rely on power stations fueled by coal or gas. Company executives were starting to price in carbon emissions reduction while motorists enjoyed not having to refuel their vehicles as often, he said. \\u201cReality has a way of intruding,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhatever uncertainly exists around the near-term policy choices of the next president, I am absolutely confident the United States will continue making progress on this path to a low-carbon future.\\u201d  \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s because many of the trends I\\u2019ve mentioned have taken hold and are no longer dependent on government initiatives. They are market-driven, they are common sense.\\u201d Trump has vowed that within his first 100 days in office he will rescind the Clean Power Plan, eliminate \\u201cunwarranted restrictions\\u201d on hydraulic fracturing oil-drilling technology, cut \\u201coutdated\\u201d regulations, and pull the country out of a global pact to curb warming of the planet. Biden said, \\u201cOne of the things the president and I are proudest of accomplishing over the last eight years is debunking the myth that America can\\u2019t grow our economy and bring down emissions at the same time.\\u201d. Among those in the audience for Biden\\u2019s remarks was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who is also taking an aggressive stance on climate change.  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"fake or true?\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"true\",\n          \"fake\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
